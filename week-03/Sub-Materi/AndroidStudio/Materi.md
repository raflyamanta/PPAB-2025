- **Fast emulator** with a rich set of configurations.
- **Flexible build system** using Gradle.
- **Testing tools** and frameworks to create and run unit tests, UI tests, and other types of automated testing.
- **Support for Kotlin, Java, and C++**.

## System Requirements
To use Android Studio effectively, ensure your system meets the following minimum requirements:

**Windows:**
- 64-bit Microsoft® Windows® 8/10/11
